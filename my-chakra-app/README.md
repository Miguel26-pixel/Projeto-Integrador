This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

### Server Environment Setup
Before running the application, it is necessary to set up the container which our database will use. In order to aid in this process, we created some bash scripts, located inside the `scripts` folder:

> **configure_server.sh** : this script will download the dockerimage we're currently using to host our database

> **run_server.sh** : this script will run the container which will host our database

> **populate_server.sh** : this script will configure, seed and populate the database hosted on the container. **This script must be run whenever the container is restarted**

### Running the application

After the server environment is correctly configured, we can now start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
